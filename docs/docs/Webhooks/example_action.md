## Example of Webhook Receiver

To experiment with webhooks or for development purposes, you can use services like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to quickly establish a webhook receiver. For instance, to receive an email for each new member request:

1. Set up a "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger, and choose the "Catch Raw Hook" event to capture the raw POST data from ZTNET.

2. Add an "Send Outbound Email" action in Zapier, fill in your email address, and attach the raw POST data as the email content.

3. Copy the webhook URL generated by Zapier.
4. Go to your ZTNET organization's settings, create a new webhook receiver using the copied URL in the `Endpoint URL` field, and select the "NETWORK_JOIN" event type.
5. Enable your webhook in ZTNET and activate your Zapier workflow.

Now, whenever a new member tries to join your network in ZTNET, you'll receive an email notification through Zapier.
