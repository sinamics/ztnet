## ‚öôÔ∏è Installations

### Using Docker Compose

Skip the hassle of cloning the repository. Simply create a `docker-compose.yml` file on your machine and populate it as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15.2-alpine
    container_name: postgres
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: ztnet
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-network

      - ZT_ALLOW_MANAGEMENT_FROM=172.31.255.0/29

  next_ztnet:
    # image: sinamics/next_ztnet:latest-dev   # Use this for testing latest development build
    image: sinamics/next_ztnet:latest
    container_name: ztnet
    platform: "linux/amd64"
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - zerotier:/var/lib/zerotier-one:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      ZT_ADDR: http://zerotier:9993
      POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
      POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
      NEXTAUTH_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
      NEXTAUTH_SECRET: "random_secret"
    networks:
      - app-network
    links:
      - postgres
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - zerotier
volumes:
  zerotier:
  postgres-data:

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 172.31.255.0/29
```

To launch Next ZTNet, execute the following command in your `docker-compose.yml` directory:

`docker-compose up -d`

This action pulls necessary images, initializes the containers, and activates the services.
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Next ZTNet web interface.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The first registered user automatically gains admin privileges.

As an administrator, you possess unique capabilities not available to regular users. This includes the ability to view all registered accounts on the controller.

Please note that while admins have visibility over registered accounts, they **cannot** interact with or modify other users' networks directly. Each network's configuration and data remain exclusive to the respective user account, maintaining privacy and security for all users.

### Environment Variables

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes several environment variables that you can customize based on your needs. Here is a description of each variable:

- `POSTGRES_HOST`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL service.
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port number for the PostgreSQL service.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username for the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for the PostgreSQL database user.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The name of the PostgreSQL database.
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL for NextAuth authentication.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: The secret key for NextAuth authentication.

These are system environment variables used by the ZeroTier service and should not be changed:

- `ZT_OVERRIDE_LOCAL_CONF`: Allows overriding local ZeroTier configuration.
- `ZT_ALLOW_MANAGEMENT_FROM`: Defines the IP range allowed to access the ZeroTier management interface.
- `ZT_ADDR`: The address of the ZeroTier service.

To change any of these values, update the corresponding environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

# Development

This project welcomes contributions. To ensure smooth collaboration, please follow the steps below:

1. Please direct all Pull Requests to the `dev` branch, not `main`.

2. Before submitting a PR, make sure to run the linter and tests to check for any errors. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:
   `npm run lint` and `npm run test`

## vscode container development (recommended)

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
4. Select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>).
5. Select **Reopen in Container** when prompted.
6. Once the container is running, hit (<kbd>F1</kbd>) and type Task to open the task menu.
7. Select **Install dependencies packages** to install all the dependencies.
8. Select **Start Development Server** to start the development server.
9. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

**NOTE:** Hot reloading on Windows may not be as performant as on other operating systems. If you encounter sluggish hot reloading, consider setting the environment variable WATCHPACK_POLLING=true. However, for optimal performance, we strongly suggest utilizing the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** to develop your application. This approach will provide a swift and seamless hot reload experience, allowing you to focus on coding rather than waiting for the application to reload.

## The traditional way

To start development, first, clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/next_ztnet.git
cd next_ztnet`

### Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and set the necessary environment variables:

- `POSTGRES_HOST`=localhost
- `POSTGRES_PORT`=5432
- `POSTGRES_USER`=postgres
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`=postgres
- `POSTGRES_DB`=ztnet
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`=http://localhost:3000
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`="your_nextauth_secret"
- `MIGRATE_POSTGRES_DB`="shaddow_ztnet"
- `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL`="postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${MIGRATE_POSTGRES_DB}?schema=public"
  You need to run the following command to create the database:

`npx prisma db push`

Now start the development server:

`npm run dev`
